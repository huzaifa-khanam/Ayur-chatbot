Ayur - Phenotype Determination Chatbot
Overview:
Ayur is an interactive web-based chatbot designed to help users determine their Ayurvedic phenotype, also known as dosha, by answering a series of questions. The chatbot uses principles from Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine that classifies individuals into three primary doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha—based on their physical and emotional characteristics.

Key Features:

1. Interactive Chatbot:
Users interact with a chatbot that guides them through a series of questions related to their physical and emotional traits.

2.Dosha Determination:
Based on the answers provided, the chatbot determines the user’s predominant dosha. Each dosha represents a combination of characteristics:
Vata: Dry, light, and cool qualities.
Pitta: Hot, sharp, and intense qualities.
Kapha: Heavy, slow, and steady qualities.

3.JSON Data Integration:
The chatbot uses a JSON file to manage and categorize data such as introductory messages, questions, and dosha mappings. This approach ensures flexibility and easy updates without affecting the chatbot’s core functionality.

4.User Interaction:
The user starts the interaction with an introductory message.
The chatbot then presents questions related to various traits like skin type, hair type, etc.
After answering all the questions, the chatbot calculates and displays the user’s predominant dosha.

5.Error Handling:
The chatbot handles errors gracefully, ensuring that user input is managed effectively without requiring modifications to the JSON file.

6.UI/UX Design:
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, featuring a clean layout with responsive design elements.
